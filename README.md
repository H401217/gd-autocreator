# gd-autocreator

**The code depends of [SPWN](https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language) installed in PATH**

Lua code for creating gd layouts using beats.

- Simulates GD physics (only gravity)
- Adds random orbs when the icon can't jump in the air
- Writes SPWN code to a file (path is modifiable)
- Executes SPWN to build the level (disabled by default)
